## Lambda

## They are a shorthand to create anonymous functions;
## the expression lambda arguments: expression yields a function object.
## The unnamed object behaves like a function object.

## SEND + MORE == MONEY

## Normal Function (Statement)

def pre_compile(S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y):
    return (D+10*N+100*E+1000*S)+(E+10*R+100*O+1000*M) \
           ==(Y+10*E+100*N+1000*O+10000*M)

## Eval does take a statement, it takes an expression.

## In comes Lambda --> (Greek) Branch of Mathematics defining Function

lambda S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y:(D+10*N+100*E+1000*S)+(E+10*R+100*O+1000*M) \
       ==(Y+10*E+100*N+1000*O+10000*M)
