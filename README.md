Course Review
=============

Overall, the course was great.  I'd been looking for a course on Python that
takes you beyond the basic language contructs.  There are interesting
intermediate concepts in the course that raise your level of thinking on how
to solve problems with Python.  I would suggest it to anyone who is looking
for more than the typical 'Hello, World' lessons often given in programming
courseware.
